Gender Detection Model 
The task is to develop a robust gender detection model using computer vision techniques. The model should be able to accurately classify the gender of individuals depicted in images as either male or female. This project aims to create a scalable solution that can process large datasets of diverse images and provide reliable gender predictions in real-time.
